# About

## Ricardo Dani - Senior/Staff Full Stack Developer

I specialize in building web applications using Python and TypeScript/JavaScript. With extensive experience in both NoSQL and relational databases, I am well-equipped to handle any data-related challenges. Additionally, I have significant experience with AWS services, particularly Lambda, EC2, RDS, DynamoDB, and SQS/SNS, which has allowed me to deploy and manage applications in the cloud, creating scalable architectures.

With my expertise in designing scalable and well-architected code, as well as my infrastructure knowledge using AWS services, I have helped several companies achieve their business goals. I possess good communication skills, problem-solving skills, and the ability to work collaboratively with cross-functional teams. I am committed to mentoring and developing developers, fostering a culture of continuous learning, and promoting best practices in software development.

Currently working as a Staff Engineer, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality solutions using free and open-source technologies.
